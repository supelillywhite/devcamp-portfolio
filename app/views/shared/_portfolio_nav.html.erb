        <p class="text-muted">I love solving problems. As a buyer at Campsaver.com, I tracked down thousands of dollars in inventory that had been lost for over two years. As the general manager for new ownership at Veyo Pool I doubled profits for the summer of 2017. As a climbing guide, I kept my clients safe and exhilarated in extreme conditions. As a programmer, I get to solve complex problems every day.</p>
